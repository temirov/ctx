# Changelog

## [v0.2.1] - 2025-10-19

### Highlights

* **Consistent CLI booleans and clipboard flag rename.** All commands now share a single boolean flag parser that understands true/false, yes/no, on/off, and 1/0
literals, and the former `--clipboard` flag has been renamed to `--copy` with configuration defaults preserved.

### Improvements ‚öôÔ∏è

* Replaced every direct `BoolVar` registration with the shared registrar, eliminating bespoke parsers and ensuring `--flag no` works everywhere. (improvement/CT-22-
bool-flags)
* Stopped normalizing boolean flags after the `--` sentinel so dash-prefixed filenames (e.g., `ctx tree -- --summary`) are handled correctly. (improvement/CT-22-
bool-flags)
* Updated configuration loading to honor both legacy `clipboard` and new `copy` keys, retaining overrides from user config. (maintenance/CT-21-copy-flag)

### Docs üìö

* Documented the expanded boolean syntax and the new `--copy` flag in the README, along with guidance for enabling automatic copy via config.

### Testing ‚úÖ

* Added unit coverage for the boolean flag registrar, including argument normalization around the `--` terminator and non-boolean trailing values.

## [v0.2.0] - 2025-10-18

### Highlights

* **GitHub-backed documentation retrieval via `ctx doc`.** A dedicated command now walks repository directories through the GitHub Contents API, applies rule-driven cleanup, and renders curated documentation in raw, JSON, or XML formats with clipboard support. (feature/CT-16-github-docs)
* **Human-readable CLI diagnostics.** Fatal errors surface as plain text alongside richer flag guidance, keeping workflows approachable for operators and MCP clients alike. (bugfix/CT-doc-help)

### Features ‚ú®

* Added `internal/docs/githubdoc` with recursive fetchers, rule set loaders, and sorting to deliver deterministic documentation bundles for remote repositories. (feature/CT-16-github-docs)
* Introduced the `doc`/`d` Cobra command with flags for owner, repo, ref, rules, documentation mode, and clipboard usage, seamlessly reusing configuration defaults. (feature/CT-16-github-docs)

### Improvements ‚öôÔ∏è

* Removed the deprecated static documentation rule scaffolding in favor of runtime rule evaluation sourced from local files. (feature/CT-16-github-docs)
* Redesigned `ctx doc` error handling and help text to spell out unified `--path` coordinates and clipboard options. (bugfix/CT-doc-help)
* Switched zap to console encoding without metadata noise so `application execution failed` lines print as a single human-readable sentence. (bugfix/CT-doc-help)
* Consolidated doc command coordinates behind a single `--path` flag that accepts `owner/repo[/path]` specs or GitHub URLs while preserving explicit `--ref` overrides. (maintenance/CT-19-doc-path)

### Docs üìö

* Documented doc command parameters in README, outlining required coordinates, optional flags, and clipboard behavior. (bugfix/CT-doc-help)

### Testing ‚úÖ

* Added integration tests that spin up a GitHub mock server and verify `ctx doc` across full and relevant modes for jspreadsheet, marked.js, and beer.css fixtures. (feature/CT-16-github-docs)

### Maintenance üõ†Ô∏è

* Removed `PLAN.md` from version control and added a guard test that fails when the file becomes tracked again. (maintenance/CT-20-plan-guard)

## [v0.1.2] - 2025-10-18

### Highlights

* **CGO-enabled builds across CI and release targets.** Test and release workflows now compile with `CGO_ENABLED=1`, ensuring Python and JavaScript call-chain analyzers are always included. Windows releases automatically install a MinGW toolchain so tree-sitter bindings build deterministically. (maintenance/CT-15-enable-cgo)

### Improvements ‚öôÔ∏è

* Switched the test workflow to run with CGO enabled, preventing accidental regressions in language analyzers. (maintenance/CT-15-enable-cgo)
* Reworked the release pipeline to build per-platform artifacts on native runners, upload them as artifacts, generate checksums, and publish consistently. (maintenance/CT-15-enable-cgo)
* Hardened release note extraction so publishing succeeds even when the changelog entry is missing. (maintenance/CT-15-enable-cgo)

### Maintenance üõ†Ô∏è

* Installed the MinGW toolchain on Windows release runners, guaranteeing CGO builds succeed without manual setup. (maintenance/CT-15-enable-cgo)

## [v0.1.1] - 2025-10-17

### Highlights

* **Richer MCP contract with advertised workspace metadata.** The MCP server now exposes `/environment` and includes the root directory in `/capabilities`, guiding agents to send absolute paths. (ba36898)
* **Comprehensive MCP end-to-end coverage.** A new integration test starts `ctx --mcp`, queries capabilities, and exercises tree/content commands over HTTP against a seeded project. (ecdacec)

### Features ‚ú®

* Documented workflow for registering `ctx` with Claude Desktop and Codex, including JSON-only semantics and environment probing. (69165c4, daec63f)

### Improvements ‚öôÔ∏è

* Expanded capability descriptions to list supported flags and JSON-only behavior, making the MCP surface self-descriptive for agents. (daec63f)

### Docs üìö

### Testing ‚úÖ

* Added an automated MCP end-to-end test that launches the server, inspects capabilities, and runs tree/content commands using absolute paths. (ecdacec)

## [v0.1.0] - 2025-10-14

### Highlights

* **Run ctx as an MCP server with JSON endpoints.** The CLI now exposes tree, content, and callchain commands over HTTP with structured capability metadata and an environment probe, ready for orchestrators. (615e90e, 245efa5, 9a6a099, ba36898, daec63f)
* **Cross-language callchain analysis with documentation harvesting.** Go, Python, and JavaScript analyzers collaborate with a new collector to surface external docs alongside call graphs. (cc2fc6f, 2d6c9c5, 47d0498)

### Features ‚ú®

* Introduced the `--mcp` flag to launch an MCP server that accepts JSON payloads, dispatches built-in commands, and returns normalized responses with warning streams. (615e90e, 245efa5, 9a6a099)
* Added configuration bootstrap and discovery: `--init` scaffolds local or global config, `--force` handles overwrites, and `--config` loads per-command defaults via Viper. (5e9f0d9, f95f300)
* Enabled multi-language documentation extraction so content listings can enrich files with Go, Python, and JavaScript API references. (2d6c9c5)
* Registered language-specific callchain analyzers and a dispatcher to resolve symbols across Go, Python, and JavaScript projects. (cc2fc6f)

### Improvements ‚öôÔ∏è

* Unified tree and content streaming through a shared event dispatcher to keep raw, JSON, and XML outputs synchronized. (f95f300)
* Hardened MCP command handling by enforcing JSON formats and per-command defaults for inputs and warnings. (9a6a099, 245efa5)
* Added a clipboard service abstraction so `--clipboard` copies output without leaking platform specifics. (f95f300)
* Fell back to rune-based counting when tokenizer models are unavailable, while reporting the requested model name. (2d6c9c5)

### Fixes üêõ

* Blocked nested call capture in Python and JavaScript analyzers to remove duplicate edges from call graphs. (47d0498)

### Docs üìö

* Expanded MCP documentation with local server workflows, Claude and Codex integration notes, and JSON contract details. (69165c4, 2530046, c620c45)
* Captured future roadmap and portability notes for CT-01 and CT-02 scenarios. (2d59656, cc7a681, 76fef18)
* Refined README formatting and release linkage for improved navigation. (527ad95, b0272f8, 446e414)

### Testing ‚úÖ

## [v0.0.15] - 2025-10-06

### Highlights

* **Real-time, schema-valid streaming across all formats.** Tree and content commands now share a single streaming
  pipeline that emits per-directory and per-file events, producing identical results for raw/JSON/XML while displaying
  output incrementally. (3f80e9d, e858f67, 5d8895b, da3f01a)
* **Resilient tokenizer integration.** Python helpers are autodetected via `uv`, sentencepiece models download on demand,
  and Claude model aliases map automatically so token counting ‚Äújust works‚Äù without manual setup. (6af6a24, b8a6330,
  a7b3354, 979e156, 909039b)

### Features ‚ú®

* Added automatic `uv` invocation for helper scripts, including on-demand sentencepiece downloads for Llama models and
  self-contained Anthropic helpers. (6af6a24, b8a6330, a7b3354, 979e156)
* Tokenizer metadata is now surfaced in both tree and content summaries, with default summaries enabled for every run.
  (d4e42c5, 46b982f, ea3098e)

### Improvements ‚öôÔ∏è

* Unified tree/content streaming walker captures file contents, streams chunks, and keeps JSON/XML renderers in sync
  while maintaining pretty-printed output. (3f80e9d, 5d8895b, da3f01a)
* CLI displays streaming progress while helpers count tokens and ensures trailing newlines so prompts resume cleanly.
  (509805a, d02f35c, e858f67)
* Fixed double counting in summaries and guaranteed `done` events even when traversal encounters errors. (9c511ab)

### Fixes üêõ

* Removed spurious helper bootstrap output and normalized Anthropic payloads, preventing API failures. (7f09f1a,
  b8f3737, 2962cf9)
* Dropped stale llama warning suppression and ensured Anthropic helpers require a valid API key with helpful messaging.
  (e96e07c, 9c73429)

### Docs üìö

* Documented tokenizer model support, uv requirements, and the need to quote shell wildcards when excluding files.
  (663c7f9, edce64b, dee8da2)

### Maintenance üõ†Ô∏è

* Updated the toolchain to the latest Go release. (e15aa61)

### Tests ‚úÖ

* Expanded streaming coverage, including helper-driven tokenization and end-to-end CLI fixtures for raw/JSON/XML output.
  (748785c, 4b84cbb, e14ea9c)

**Upgrade notes:** Ensure `uv` is on `PATH`; the CLI will fetch helper dependencies and models automatically. Provide an
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` when requesting Claude token counts.

---

## [v0.0.9] - 2025-04-15

### What's New üéâ

1. JSON is a default output format

## [v0.0.8] - 2025-04-15

### What's New üéâ

1. Renamed `content` to `ctx`

## [v0.0.7] - 2025-04-13

### Features ‚ú®

1. **Call Chain Analysis Command (`callchain`, `cc`):**
    - Added a new command `callchain` (alias `cc`) to analyze the call graph for a specified function within the
      repository.
    - Usage: `content callchain <function_name> [--format <raw|json>]`
    - The `<function_name>` argument should be a fully qualified name (e.g., `github.com/org/repo/pkg.MyFunction`) or a
      unique suffix.
    - **Raw Output (`--format raw` or default):** Displays the target function, its direct callers, and its direct
      callees in a human-readable format, followed by the source code of these functions.
    - **JSON Output (`--format json`):** Outputs a JSON object containing the `targetFunction`, arrays of `callers` and
      `callees` (fully qualified names), and a `functions` map where keys are function names and values are their source
      code strings.

## [v0.0.6] - 2025-04-08

### Features ‚ú®

1. **Version Flag:** Added a `--version` flag to display the application version.

### Bug Fixes üêõ

1. **Version Verbiage:** Corrected the wording used when displaying the version information.

## [v0.0.5] - 2025-03-29

### Features ‚ú®

1. **JSON Output Format:**
    - Added a `--format <type>` flag.
    - Supported types are `raw` (default) and `json`.
    - `--format json` outputs results in a structured JSON format suitable for machine processing (e.g., by AI tools).
    - `content content --format json`: Outputs an array of objects, each with `path`, `type` ("file"), and `content` for
      successfully read files.
    - `content tree --format json`: Outputs an array representing input paths. Files have `path` and `type`. Directories
      have `path`, `type`, and nested `children`.
    - The default `raw` format preserves the original human-readable text output.

## [v0.0.3] - 2025-03-29

### Features ‚ú®

1. **Multi-Directory Support:**
   The tool now accepts multiple directory paths as positional arguments.
   `content <command> [dir1] [dir2] ... [flags]`
    - `.ignore` and `.gitignore` files are loaded relative to *each* specified directory.
    - The `-e`/`--e` exclusion flag applies to direct children within *any* of the specified directories.
    - Output for `tree` shows separate trees for each directory.
    - Output for `content` concatenates file contents from all specified directories sequentially.
    - Duplicate input directories (after resolving paths) are processed only once.
    - If no directories are specified, it defaults to the current directory (`.`).

2. **Mixed File/Directory Input:**
   The tool now accepts both file and directory paths as positional arguments.
   `content <command> [path1] [path2] ... [flags]`
    - For the `content` command:
        - Explicitly listed files have their content printed directly.
        - Directories are traversed recursively, printing content of non-ignored files within them.
    - For the `tree` command:
        - Directories are traversed, displaying their structure.
        - Explicitly listed files are shown with a `[File]` marker and their absolute path.
    - Ignore rules (`.ignore`, `.gitignore`, `-e`) only apply during the traversal of *directory* arguments. Explicitly
      listed files are *never* filtered by ignore rules.

## [v0.0.2] - 2025-03-23

### What's New üéâ

1. **Using `.ignore` Instead of `.ignore`:**
   The tool now looks for a file named **.ignore** for exclusion patterns.

2. **Processing `.gitignore` by Default:**
   The tool loads **.gitignore** by default if present. Use the `--no-gitignore` flag to disable this.

3. **Folder Exclusion Flags:**
   Both **-e** and **--e** flags now work for specifying an exclusion folder. The folder is excluded only when it
   appears as a direct child of the working directory.

4. **Disabling Ignore File Logic:**
    - **--no-gitignore:** Prevents the tool from reading the **.gitignore** file.
    - **--no-ignore:** Prevents the tool from reading the **.ignore** file.

5. **Command Abbreviations:**
   Short forms **t** for **tree** and **c** for **content** are now supported.
