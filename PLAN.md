# Plan

## CT-12 Document MCP Usage With Examples
- Review existing MCP documentation in `README.md` and identify gaps around startup instructions, capability discovery, and shutdown expectations.
- Extend the README with a complete walkthrough that shows running `ctx --mcp`, interpreting the startup message, and querying capabilities with `curl`.
- Update NOTES.md to mark CT-12 as complete and summarize the new documentation so maintenance tracking stays accurate.
