# Notes

## Rules of engagement

Review the notes.md. Make a plan for autonomously fixing every bug. Ensure no regressions. Ensure adding tests. Lean into integration tests. Fix every bug.

Fix bugs one by one. Write a nice comprehensive commit message AFTER EACH bug is fixed and tested and covered with tests. Do not work on all bugs at all. Work at one bug at a time sequntially. 

Remove a bug from the notes.md after the bug is fixed. commit and push to the remote.

Leave Bugfix section empty but dont delete the section itself.
